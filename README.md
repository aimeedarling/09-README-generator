# README Generator

## Description
----

I've created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. By making this project I am able to showcase my new skills of using node js and node package manager to install Inquirer.

## Installation
----

Once you've cloned the repo to your machine, please navigate to the folder in the command line. Then type:
  
``node index.js``
  
in your terminal. Then simply follow the prompts. Your README file will generate in the dist folder. ðŸ™‚


## Usage
----

You might want to use this app to help organize a README file for your next project.
